# Contributing to StockStalker

StockStalker is an open source application designed to help the average investor get ahead of market changes. This application is still in its early releases, and we welcome assistance with finding bugs or improving *your* experience as a user.

We're so excited that you're interested in contributing to StockStalker! Please read these guidelines thoroughly before getting started.

*Note: the Issues tracker is for bugs and improvement requests. For questions on how to use StockStalker, if you want to join our team, or if you'd like to contribute code, please [contact our contributors](mailto:stockstalkertk@protonmail.com) for more information*.

## Issues

Issues are a huge part of making StockStalker the best it can be. However, please follow our issues templates carefully, and consider the following before adding an issue to the repository:

**Tell Us**:

- What are you doing?
  - Please include screenshots or steps to reproduce the bug you've found. The more descriptive the better!
  - What did you expect to happen? (i.e: "I expected to see a new stock add to my watchlist.")
  - What actually happened? (i.e: "The stock did not show up until I refreshed the page.")
- What browser are you using?
- If you know how to check the developer tools, can you share a screenshot of anything that appeared in the console at the time of encountering the bug?

The more description we get, the faster we can find and fix bugs. If you're experienced at this and know what is likely to be causing the bug, feel free to also include a detailed explanation of your hunch - the more links to files and code snippets you can include, the better!

## Feature/Improvement Requests

Feature and improvement requests will be a big part in moving StockStalker forward for major releases. However, please be advised that the StockStalker team reserves the right to decline any feature or improvement requests that we don't feel would benefit the majority of our users enough of the time, or that extend beyond the core mission of StockStalker.

**Tell Us**:

- In a few words, what's your request?
  - For example: "I'd like to see a more robust search algorithm utilized so I can find my stock even if I make a typo."
- How often would this request improve your experience?
  - For example: "I tend to be in a rush when I use StockStalker, and I could use this about 50% of the time."
- How widely applicable is your use case (among other users)?
  - For example, search is likely to affect everyone, but there may be an issue that only affects your profile for some reason. We realize that answering this question requires some guesswork, so just use your intuition, there are no wrong answers. This just helps us gauge necessity.

The ideal feature or improvement request augments the *core* functionality and goals of StockStalker. With that being said, we're open to hearing any ideas you have that will help you get the most out of StockStalker.
